TrainWorld II
---

Welcome, dear traveller or meddler!

FAQ
===

### Is it finished?

No.

### Is there a TrainWorld I?

No.  There are unrelated things called TrainWorld, so the II
is a cheesy way to give this project a more unique name.

### Why do the trains move in a way that doesn't make much sense?

There is no dispatcher, except maybe the viewer.

### Who is paying for this?

In a fantasy world, you can build train tracks and power trains for
free, effortlessly. Right? Right???
